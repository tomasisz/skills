# User Research

Help plan, execute, and synthesize user research studies.

## Research Methods

| Method | Best For | Sample Size | Time |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| User interviews | Deep understanding of needs and motivations | 5-8 | 2-4 weeks |
| Usability testing | Evaluating a specific design or flow | 5-8 | 1-2 weeks |
| Surveys | Quantifying attitudes and preferences | 100+ | 1-2 weeks |
| Card sorting | Information architecture decisions | 15-30 | 1 week |
| Diary studies | Understanding behavior over time | 10-15 | 2-8 weeks |
| A/B testing | Comparing specific design choices | Statistical significance | 1-4 weeks |

## Interview Guide Structure

1. **Warm-up** (5 min): Build rapport, explain the session
2. **Context** (10 min): Understand their current workflow
3. **Deep dive** (20 min): Explore the specific topic
4. **Reaction** (10 min): Show concepts or prototypes
5. **Wrap-up** (5 min): Anything we missed? Thank them.

## Analysis Framework

- **Affinity mapping**: Group observations into themes
- **Impact/effort matrix**: Prioritize findings
- **Journey mapping**: Visualize the user experience over time
- **Jobs to be done**: Understand what users are hiring your product to do

## Deliverables

- Research plan (objectives, methods, timeline, participants)
- Interview guide (questions, probes, activities)
- Synthesis report (themes, insights, recommendations)
- Highlight reel (key quotes and observations)

name: design-handoff
description: Create comprehensive developer handoff documentation from designs. Trigger with "handoff to engineering", "developer specs", "implementation notes", "design specs for developers", or when a design needs to be translated into detailed implementation guidance.
---

# Design Handoff

Create clear, complete handoff documentation so developers can implement designs accurately.

## What to Include

### Visual Specifications
- Exact measurements (padding, margins, widths)
- Design token references (colors, typography, spacing)
- Responsive breakpoints and behavior
- Component variants and states

### Interaction Specifications
- Click/tap behavior
- Hover states
- Transitions and animations (duration, easing)
- Gesture support (swipe, pinch, long-press)

### Content Specifications
- Character limits
- Truncation behavior
- Empty states
- Loading states
- Error states

### Edge Cases
- Minimum/maximum content
- International text (longer strings)
- Slow connections
- Missing data

### Accessibility
- Focus order
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard interactions
- Screen reader announcements

## Principles

1. **Don't assume** — If it's not specified, the developer will guess. Specify everything.
2. **Use tokens, not values** — Reference `spacing-md` not `16px`.
3. **Show all states** — Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty.
4. **Describe the why** — "This collapses on mobile because users primarily use one-handed" helps developers make good judgment calls.

name: design-critique
description: Evaluate designs for usability, visual hierarchy, consistency, and adherence to design principles. Trigger with "what do you think of this design", "give me feedback on", "critique this", "review this mockup", or when the user shares a design and asks for opinions.
---

# Design Critique

Provide structured, actionable design feedback.

## Critique Framework

### 1. First Impression (2 seconds)
- What draws the eye first? Is that correct?
- What's the emotional reaction?
- Is the purpose immediately clear?

### 2. Usability
- Can the user accomplish their goal?
- Is the navigation intuitive?
- Are interactive elements obvious?
- Are there unnecessary steps?

### 3. Visual Hierarchy
- Is there a clear reading order?
- Are the right elements emphasized?
- Is whitespace used effectively?
- Is typography creating the right hierarchy?

### 4. Consistency
- Does it follow the design system?
- Are spacing, colors, and typography consistent?
- Do similar elements behave similarly?

### 5. Accessibility
- Color contrast ratios
- Touch target sizes
- Text readability
- Alternative text for images

## How to Give Feedback

- **Be specific**: "The CTA competes with the navigation" not "the layout is confusing"
- **Explain why**: Connect feedback to design principles or user needs
- **Suggest alternatives**: Don't just identify problems, propose solutions
- **Acknowledge what works**: Good feedback includes positive observations
- **Match the stage**: Early exploration gets different feedback than final polish

# Design System Management

Help build, maintain, and evolve design systems.

## Components of a Design System

### Design Tokens
Atomic values that define the visual language:
- Colors (brand, semantic, neutral)
- Typography (scale, weights, line heights)
- Spacing (scale, component padding)
- Borders (radius, width)
- Shadows (elevation levels)
- Motion (durations, easings)

### Components
Reusable UI elements with defined:
- Variants (primary, secondary, ghost)
- States (default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error)
- Sizes (sm, md, lg)
- Behavior (interactions, animations)
- Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard)

### Patterns
Common UI solutions combining components:
- Forms (input groups, validation, submission)
- Navigation (sidebar, tabs, breadcrumbs)
- Data display (tables, cards, lists)
- Feedback (toasts, modals, inline messages)

## Principles

1. **Consistency over creativity** — The system exists so teams don't reinvent the wheel
2. **Flexibility within constraints** — Components should be composable, not rigid
3. **Document everything** — If it's not documented, it doesn't exist
4. **Version and migrate** — Breaking changes need migration paths

# Accessibility Review

Evaluate designs and implementations against WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## WCAG 2.1 AA Quick Reference

### Perceivable
- **1.1.1** Non-text content has alt text
- **1.3.1** Info and structure conveyed semantically
- **1.4.3** Contrast ratio >= 4.5:1 (normal text), >= 3:1 (large text)
- **1.4.11** Non-text contrast >= 3:1 (UI components, graphics)

### Operable
- **2.1.1** All functionality available via keyboard
- **2.4.3** Logical focus order
- **2.4.7** Visible focus indicator
- **2.5.5** Touch target >= 44x44 CSS pixels

### Understandable
- **3.2.1** Predictable on focus (no unexpected changes)
- **3.3.1** Error identification (describe the error)
- **3.3.2** Labels or instructions for inputs

### Robust
- **4.1.2** Name, role, value for all UI components

## Common Issues

1. Insufficient color contrast
2. Missing form labels
3. No keyboard access to interactive elements
4. Missing alt text on meaningful images
5. Focus traps in modals
6. Missing ARIA landmarks
7. Auto-playing media without controls
8. Time limits without extension options

## Testing Approach

1. Automated scan (catches ~30% of issues)
2. Keyboard-only navigation
3. Screen reader testing (VoiceOver, NVDA)
4. Color contrast verification
5. Zoom to 200% — does layout break?

name: ux-writing
description: Write effective microcopy for user interfaces. Trigger with "write copy for", "help with UX copy", "what should this button say", "error message for", "empty state copy", or when the user needs help with any interface text.
---

# UX Writing

Write clear, concise, and helpful interface copy.

## Principles

1. **Clear**: Say exactly what you mean. No jargon, no ambiguity.
2. **Concise**: Use the fewest words that convey the full meaning.
3. **Consistent**: Same terms for the same things everywhere.
4. **Useful**: Every word should help the user accomplish their goal.
5. **Human**: Write like a helpful person, not a robot.

## Copy Patterns

### CTAs
- Start with a verb: "Start free trial", "Save changes", "Download report"
- Be specific: "Create account" not "Submit"
- Match the outcome to the label

### Error Messages
Structure: What happened + Why + How to fix
- "Payment declined. Your card was declined by your bank. Try a different card or contact your bank."

### Empty States
Structure: What this is + Why it's empty + How to start
- "No projects yet. Create your first project to start collaborating with your team."

### Confirmation Dialogs
- Make the action clear: "Delete 3 files?" not "Are you sure?"
- Describe consequences: "This can't be undone"
- Label buttons with the action: "Delete files" / "Keep files" not "OK" / "Cancel"

## Voice and Tone

Adapt tone to context:
- **Success**: Celebratory but not over the top
- **Error**: Empathetic and helpful
- **Warning**: Clear and actionable
- **Neutral**: Informative and concise
