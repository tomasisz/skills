name: scientific-problem-selection
description: This skill should be used when scientists need help with research problem selection, project ideation, troubleshooting stuck projects, or strategic scientific decisions. Use this skill when users ask to pitch a new research idea, work through a project problem, evaluate project risks, plan research strategy, navigate decision trees, or get help choosing what scientific problem to work on. Typical requests include "I have an idea for a project", "I'm stuck on my research", "help me evaluate this project", "what should I work on", or "I need strategic advice about my research".

# Scientific Problem Selection Skills

A conversational framework for systematic scientific problem selection based on Fischbach & Walsh's "Problem choice and decision trees in science and engineering" (Cell, 2024).

## Getting Started

Present users with three entry points:

**1) Pitch an idea for a new project** — to work it up together

**2) Share a problem in a current project** — to troubleshoot together

**3) Ask a strategic question** — to navigate the decision tree together

This conversational entry meets scientists where they are and establishes a collaborative tone.

---

## Option 1: Pitch an Idea

### Initial Prompt
Ask: **"Tell me the short version of your idea (1-2 sentences)."**

### Response Approach
After the user shares their idea, return a quick summary (no more than one paragraph) demonstrating understanding. Note the general area of research and rephrase the idea in a way that highlights its kernel—showing alignment and readiness to dive into details.

### Follow-up Prompt
Then ask for more detail: "Now give me a bit more detail. You might include, however briefly or even say where you are unsure:
1. What exactly you want to do
2. How you currently plan to do it
3. If it works, why will it be a big deal
4. What you think are the major risks"

### Workflow
From there, guide the user through the early stages of problem selection and evaluation:
- **Skill 1: Intuition Pumps** - Refine and strengthen the idea
- **Skill 2: Risk Assessment** - Identify and manage project risks
- **Skill 3: Optimization Function** - Define success metrics
- **Skill 4: Parameter Strategy** - Determine what to fix vs. keep flexible

See `references/01-intuition-pumps.md`, `references/02-risk-assessment.md`, `references/03-optimization-function.md`, and `references/04-parameter-strategy.md` for detailed guidance.

---

## Option 2: Troubleshoot a Problem

### Initial Prompt
Ask: **"Tell me a short version of your problem (1-2 sentences or whatever is easy)."**

### Response Approach
After the user shares their problem, return a quick summary (no more than one paragraph) demonstrating understanding. Note the context of the project where the problem occurred and rephrase the problem—highlighting its core essence—so the user knows the situation is understood. Also raise additional questions that seem important to discuss.

### Follow-up Prompt
Then ask: "Now give me a bit more detail. You might include, however briefly:
1. The overall goal of your project (if we have not talked about it before)
2. What exactly went wrong
3. Your current ideas for fixing it"

### Workflow
From there, guide the user through troubleshooting and decision tree navigation:
- **Skill 5: Decision Tree Navigation** - Plan decision points and navigate between execution and strategic thinking
- **Skill 4: Parameter Strategy** - Fix one parameter at a time, let others float
- **Skill 6: Adversity Response** - Frame problems as opportunities for growth
- **Skill 7: Problem Inversion** - Strategies for navigating around obstacles

Always include workarounds that might be useful whether or not the problem can be fixed easily.

See `references/05-decision-tree.md`, `references/06-adversity-planning.md`, `references/07-problem-inversion.md`, and `references/04-parameter-strategy.md` for detailed guidance.

---

## Option 3: Ask a Strategic Question

### Initial Prompt
Ask: **"Tell me the short version of your question (1-2 sentences)."**

### Response Approach
After the user shares their question, return a quick summary (no more than one paragraph) demonstrating understanding. Note the broader context and rephrase the question—highlighting its crux—to confirm alignment with their thinking.

### Follow-up Prompt
Then ask: "Now give me a bit more detail. You might include, however briefly:
1. The setting (i.e., is this about a current or future project)
2. A bit more detail about what you're thinking"

### Workflow
From there, draw on the specific modules from the problem choice framework most appropriate to the question:
- **Skills 1-4** for future project planning (ideation, risk, optimization, parameters)
- **Skills 5-7** for current project navigation (decision trees, adversity, inversion)
- **Skill 8** for communication and synthesis
- **Skill 9** for comprehensive workflow orchestration

See the complete reference materials in the `references/` folder.

## Core Framework Concepts

### The Central Insight
**Problem Choice >> Execution Quality**

Even brilliant execution of a mediocre problem yields incremental impact. Good execution of an important problem yields substantial impact.

### The Time Paradox
Scientists typically spend:
- **Days** choosing a problem
- **Years** solving it

This imbalance limits impact. These skills help invest more time choosing wisely.

### Evaluation Axes
**For Evaluating Ideas:**
- **X-axis:** Likelihood of success
- **Y-axis:** Impact if successful

Skills help move ideas rightward (more feasible) and upward (more impactful).

### The Risk Paradox
- Don't avoid risk—befriend it
- No risk = incremental work
- But: Multiple miracles = avoid or refine
- **Balance:** Understood, quantified, manageable risk

### The Parameter Paradox
- Too many fixed = brittleness
- Too few fixed = paralysis
- **Sweet spot:** Fix ONE meaningful constraint

### The Adversity Principle
- Crises are inevitable (don't be surprised)
- Crises are opportune (don't waste them)
- **Strategy:** Fix problem AND upgrade project simultaneously

2. **Thoughtful Interaction** - Ask clarifying questions; low confidence prompts additional input
3. **Literature Integration** - Use PubMed searches at strategic points for validation
4. **Concrete Outputs** - Every skill produces tangible 1-2 page documents
5. **Building Specificity** - Progressive detail emerges through targeted questions
6. **Flexibility** - Skills work independently, sequentially, or iteratively
7. **Scientific Rigor** - Claims about generality and feasibility should be evidence-based

name: single-cell-rna-qc
description: Performs quality control on single-cell RNA-seq data (.h5ad or .h5 files) using scverse best practices with MAD-based filtering and comprehensive visualizations. Use when users request QC analysis, filtering low-quality cells, assessing data quality, or following scverse/scanpy best practices for single-cell analysis.

# Single-Cell RNA-seq Quality Control

Automated QC workflow for single-cell RNA-seq data following scverse best practices.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when users:
- Request quality control or QC on single-cell RNA-seq data
- Want to filter low-quality cells or assess data quality
- Need QC visualizations or metrics
- Ask to follow scverse/scanpy best practices
- Request MAD-based filtering or outlier detection

**Supported input formats:**
- `.h5ad` files (AnnData format from scanpy/Python workflows)
- `.h5` files (10X Genomics Cell Ranger output)

**Default recommendation**: Use Approach 1 (complete pipeline) unless the user has specific custom requirements or explicitly requests non-standard filtering logic.

## Approach 1: Complete QC Pipeline (Recommended for Standard Workflows)

For standard QC following scverse best practices, use the convenience script `scripts/qc_analysis.py`:

```bash
python3 scripts/qc_analysis.py input.h5ad
# or for 10X Genomics .h5 files:
python3 scripts/qc_analysis.py raw_feature_bc_matrix.h5
```

The script automatically detects the file format and loads it appropriately.

**When to use this approach:**
- Standard QC workflow with adjustable thresholds (all cells filtered the same way)
- Batch processing multiple datasets
- Quick exploratory analysis
- User wants the "just works" solution

**Requirements:** anndata, scanpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy

**Parameters:**

Customize filtering thresholds and gene patterns using command-line parameters:
- `--output-dir` - Output directory
- `--mad-counts`, `--mad-genes`, `--mad-mt` - MAD thresholds for counts/genes/MT%
- `--mt-threshold` - Hard mitochondrial % cutoff
- `--min-cells` - Gene filtering threshold
- `--mt-pattern`, `--ribo-pattern`, `--hb-pattern` - Gene name patterns for different species

Use `--help` to see current default values.

**Outputs:**

All files are saved to `<input_basename>_qc_results/` directory by default (or to the directory specified by `--output-dir`):
- `qc_metrics_before_filtering.png` - Pre-filtering visualizations
- `qc_filtering_thresholds.png` - MAD-based threshold overlays
- `qc_metrics_after_filtering.png` - Post-filtering quality metrics
- `<input_basename>_filtered.h5ad` - Clean, filtered dataset ready for downstream analysis
- `<input_basename>_with_qc.h5ad` - Original data with QC annotations preserved

If copying outputs for user access, copy individual files (not the entire directory) so users can preview them directly.

### Workflow Steps

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Calculate QC metrics** - Count depth, gene detection, mitochondrial/ribosomal/hemoglobin content
2. **Apply MAD-based filtering** - Permissive outlier detection using MAD thresholds for counts/genes/MT%
3. **Filter genes** - Remove genes detected in few cells
4. **Generate visualizations** - Comprehensive before/after plots with threshold overlays

## Approach 2: Modular Building Blocks (For Custom Workflows)

For custom analysis workflows or non-standard requirements, use the modular utility functions from `scripts/qc_core.py` and `scripts/qc_plotting.py`:

```python
# Run from scripts/ directory, or add scripts/ to sys.path if needed
import anndata as ad
from qc_core import calculate_qc_metrics, detect_outliers_mad, filter_cells
from qc_plotting import plot_qc_distributions  # Only if visualization needed

adata = ad.read_h5ad('input.h5ad')
calculate_qc_metrics(adata, inplace=True)
# ... custom analysis logic here
```

**When to use this approach:**
- Different workflow needed (skip steps, change order, apply different thresholds to subsets)
- Conditional logic (e.g., filter neurons differently than other cells)
- Partial execution (only metrics/visualization, no filtering)
- Integration with other analysis steps in a larger pipeline
- Custom filtering criteria beyond what command-line params support

**Available utility functions:**

From `qc_core.py` (core QC operations):
- `calculate_qc_metrics(adata, mt_pattern, ribo_pattern, hb_pattern, inplace=True)` - Calculate QC metrics and annotate adata
- `detect_outliers_mad(adata, metric, n_mads, verbose=True)` - MAD-based outlier detection, returns boolean mask
- `apply_hard_threshold(adata, metric, threshold, operator='>', verbose=True)` - Apply hard cutoffs, returns boolean mask
- `filter_cells(adata, mask, inplace=False)` - Apply boolean mask to filter cells
- `filter_genes(adata, min_cells=20, min_counts=None, inplace=True)` - Filter genes by detection
- `print_qc_summary(adata, label='')` - Print summary statistics

From `qc_plotting.py` (visualization):
- `plot_qc_distributions(adata, output_path, title)` - Generate comprehensive QC plots
- `plot_filtering_thresholds(adata, outlier_masks, thresholds, output_path)` - Visualize filtering thresholds
- `plot_qc_after_filtering(adata, output_path)` - Generate post-filtering plots

**Example custom workflows:**

**Example 1: Only calculate metrics and visualize, don't filter yet**
```python
adata = ad.read_h5ad('input.h5ad')
calculate_qc_metrics(adata, inplace=True)
plot_qc_distributions(adata, 'qc_before.png', title='Initial QC')
print_qc_summary(adata, label='Before filtering')
```

**Example 2: Apply only MT% filtering, keep other metrics permissive**
```python
adata = ad.read_h5ad('input.h5ad')
calculate_qc_metrics(adata, inplace=True)

# Only filter high MT% cells
high_mt = apply_hard_threshold(adata, 'pct_counts_mt', 10, operator='>')
adata_filtered = filter_cells(adata, ~high_mt)
adata_filtered.write('filtered.h5ad')
```

**Example 3: Different thresholds for different subsets**
```python
adata = ad.read_h5ad('input.h5ad')
calculate_qc_metrics(adata, inplace=True)

# Apply type-specific QC (assumes cell_type metadata exists)
neurons = adata.obs['cell_type'] == 'neuron'
other_cells = ~neurons

# Neurons tolerate higher MT%, other cells use stricter threshold
neuron_qc = apply_hard_threshold(adata[neurons], 'pct_counts_mt', 15, operator='>')
other_qc = apply_hard_threshold(adata[other_cells], 'pct_counts_mt', 8, operator='>')
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be permissive with filtering** - Default thresholds intentionally retain most cells to avoid losing rare populations
2. **Inspect visualizations** - Always review before/after plots to ensure filtering makes biological sense
3. **Consider dataset-specific factors** - Some tissues naturally have higher mitochondrial content (e.g., neurons, cardiomyocytes)
4. **Check gene annotations** - Mitochondrial gene prefixes vary by species (mt- for mouse, MT- for human)
5. **Iterate if needed** - QC parameters may need adjustment based on the specific experiment or tissue type

## Reference Materials

For detailed QC methodology, parameter rationale, and troubleshooting guidance, see `references/scverse_qc_guidelines.md`. This reference provides:
- Detailed explanations of each QC metric and why it matters
- Rationale for MAD-based thresholds and why they're better than fixed cutoffs
- Guidelines for interpreting QC visualizations (histograms, violin plots, scatter plots)
- Species-specific considerations for gene annotations
- When and how to adjust filtering parameters
- Advanced QC considerations (ambient RNA correction, doublet detection)

Load this reference when users need deeper understanding of the methodology or when troubleshooting QC issues.

## Next Steps After QC

Typical downstream analysis steps:
- Ambient RNA correction (SoupX, CellBender)
- Doublet detection (scDblFinder)
- Normalization (log-normalize, scran)
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
- Clustering and cell type annotation

python scripts/differential_expression.py results/model results/adata_clustered.h5ad results/de.csv --groupby leiden
```

### Python Utilities

The `scripts/model_utils.py` provides importable functions for custom workflows:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `prepare_adata()` | Data preparation (QC, HVG, layer setup) |
| `train_scvi()` | Train scVI or scANVI |
| `evaluate_integration()` | Compute integration metrics |

| `save_results()` | Save model, data, plots |
| `auto_select_model()` | Suggest best model |
| `quick_clustering()` | Neighbors + UMAP + Leiden |

## Critical Requirements

1. **Raw counts required**: scvi-tools models require integer count data
   ```python
   adata.layers["counts"] = adata.X.copy()  # Before normalization
   scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(adata, layer="counts")
   ```

2. **HVG selection**: Use 2000-4000 highly variable genes
   ```python
   sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, n_top_genes=2000, batch_key="batch", layer="counts", flavor="seurat_v3")
   adata = adata[:, adata.var['highly_variable']].copy()
   ```

3. **Batch information**: Specify batch_key for integration
   ```python
   scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(adata, layer="counts", batch_key="batch")
   ```

name: nextflow-development
description: Run nf-core bioinformatics pipelines (rnaseq, sarek, atacseq) on sequencing data. Use when analyzing RNA-seq, WGS/WES, or ATAC-seq data—either local FASTQs or public datasets from GEO/SRA. Triggers on nf-core, Nextflow, FASTQ analysis, variant calling, gene expression, differential expression, GEO reanalysis, GSE/GSM/SRR accessions, or samplesheet creation.

# nf-core Pipeline Deployment

Run nf-core bioinformatics pipelines on local or public sequencing data.

**Target users:** Bench scientists and researchers without specialized bioinformatics training who need to run large-scale omics analyses—differential expression, variant calling, or chromatin accessibility analysis.

## Workflow Checklist

```
- [ ] Step 0: Acquire data (if from GEO/SRA)
- [ ] Step 1: Environment check (MUST pass)
- [ ] Step 2: Select pipeline (confirm with user)
- [ ] Step 3: Run test profile (MUST pass)
- [ ] Step 4: Create samplesheet
- [ ] Step 5: Configure & run (confirm genome with user)
- [ ] Step 6: Verify outputs
```

---

## Step 0: Acquire Data (GEO/SRA Only)

**Skip this step if user has local FASTQ files.**

For public datasets, fetch from GEO/SRA first. See [references/geo-sra-acquisition.md](references/geo-sra-acquisition.md) for the full workflow.

**Quick start:**

```bash
# 1. Get study info
python scripts/sra_geo_fetch.py info GSE110004

# 2. Download (interactive mode)
python scripts/sra_geo_fetch.py download GSE110004 -o ./fastq -i

# 3. Generate samplesheet
python scripts/sra_geo_fetch.py samplesheet GSE110004 --fastq-dir ./fastq -o samplesheet.csv
```

**DECISION POINT:** After fetching study info, confirm with user:
- Which sample subset to download (if multiple data types)
- Suggested genome and pipeline

Then continue to Step 1.

---

## Step 1: Environment Check

**Run first. Pipeline will fail without passing environment.**

```bash
python scripts/check_environment.py
```

All critical checks must pass. If any fail, provide fix instructions:

| Version < 23.04 | `nextflow self-update` |

### Java issues

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Not installed / < 11 | `sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk` |

**Do not proceed until all checks pass.** For HPC/Singularity, see [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md).

---

## Step 2: Select Pipeline

**DECISION POINT: Confirm with user before proceeding.**

| Data Type | Pipeline | Version | Goal |
|-----------|----------|---------|------|
| RNA-seq | `rnaseq` | 3.22.2 | Gene expression |
| WGS/WES | `sarek` | 3.7.1 | Variant calling |
| ATAC-seq | `atacseq` | 2.1.2 | Chromatin accessibility |

Auto-detect from data:
```bash
python scripts/detect_data_type.py /path/to/data
```

For pipeline-specific details:
- [references/pipelines/rnaseq.md](references/pipelines/rnaseq.md)
- [references/pipelines/sarek.md](references/pipelines/sarek.md)
- [references/pipelines/atacseq.md](references/pipelines/atacseq.md)

---

## Step 3: Run Test Profile

**Validates environment with small data. MUST pass before real data.**

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/<pipeline> -r <version> -profile test,docker --outdir test_output
```

| Pipeline | Command |
|----------|---------|
| rnaseq | `nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.22.2 -profile test,docker --outdir test_rnaseq` |
| sarek | `nextflow run nf-core/sarek -r 3.7.1 -profile test,docker --outdir test_sarek` |
| atacseq | `nextflow run nf-core/atacseq -r 2.1.2 -profile test,docker --outdir test_atacseq` |

Verify:
```bash
ls test_output/multiqc/multiqc_report.html
grep "Pipeline completed successfully" .nextflow.log
```

If test fails, see [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md).

---

## Step 4: Create Samplesheet

### Generate automatically

```bash
python scripts/generate_samplesheet.py /path/to/data <pipeline> -o samplesheet.csv
```

The script:
- Discovers FASTQ/BAM/CRAM files
- Pairs R1/R2 reads
- Infers sample metadata
- Validates before writing

**For sarek:** Script prompts for tumor/normal status if not auto-detected.

### Validate existing samplesheet

```bash
python scripts/generate_samplesheet.py --validate samplesheet.csv <pipeline>
```

### Samplesheet formats

**rnaseq:**
```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,strandedness
SAMPLE1,/abs/path/R1.fq.gz,/abs/path/R2.fq.gz,auto
```

**sarek:**
```csv
patient,sample,lane,fastq_1,fastq_2,status
patient1,tumor,L001,/abs/path/tumor_R1.fq.gz,/abs/path/tumor_R2.fq.gz,1
patient1,normal,L001,/abs/path/normal_R1.fq.gz,/abs/path/normal_R2.fq.gz,0
```

**atacseq:**
```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,replicate
CONTROL,/abs/path/ctrl_R1.fq.gz,/abs/path/ctrl_R2.fq.gz,1
```

---

## Step 5: Configure & Run

### 5a. Check genome availability

```bash
python scripts/manage_genomes.py check <genome>
# If not installed:
python scripts/manage_genomes.py download <genome>
```

Common genomes: GRCh38 (human), GRCh37 (legacy), GRCm39 (mouse), R64-1-1 (yeast), BDGP6 (fly)

### 5b. Decision points

**DECISION POINT: Confirm with user:**

1. **Genome:** Which reference to use
2. **Pipeline-specific options:**
   - **rnaseq:** aligner (star_salmon recommended, hisat2 for low memory)
   - **sarek:** tools (haplotypecaller for germline, mutect2 for somatic)
   - **atacseq:** read_length (50, 75, 100, or 150)

### 5c. Run pipeline

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/<pipeline> \
    -r <version> \
    -profile docker \
    --input samplesheet.csv \
    --outdir results \
    --genome <genome> \
    -resume
```

**Key flags:**
- `-r`: Pin version
- `-profile docker`: Use Docker (or `singularity` for HPC)
- `--genome`: iGenomes key
- `-resume`: Continue from checkpoint

**Resource limits (if needed):**
```bash
--max_cpus 8 --max_memory '32.GB' --max_time '24.h'
```

---

## Step 6: Verify Outputs

### Check completion

```bash
ls results/multiqc/multiqc_report.html
grep "Pipeline completed successfully" .nextflow.log
```

### Key outputs by pipeline

**rnaseq:**
- `results/star_salmon/salmon.merged.gene_counts.tsv` - Gene counts
- `results/star_salmon/salmon.merged.gene_tpm.tsv` - TPM values

**sarek:**
- `results/variant_calling/*/` - VCF files
- `results/preprocessing/recalibrated/` - BAM files

**atacseq:**
- `results/macs2/narrowPeak/` - Peak calls
- `results/bwa/mergedLibrary/bigwig/` - Coverage tracks

---

For common exit codes and fixes, see [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md).

### Resume failed run

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/<pipeline> -resume
```

## Disclaimer

This skill is provided as a prototype example demonstrating how to integrate nf-core bioinformatics pipelines into Claude Code for automated analysis workflows. The current implementation supports three pipelines (rnaseq, sarek, and atacseq), serving as a foundation that enables the community to expand support to the full set of nf-core pipelines.

It is intended for educational and research purposes and should not be considered production-ready without appropriate validation for your specific use case. Users are responsible for ensuring their computing environment meets pipeline requirements and for verifying analysis results.

Anthropic does not guarantee the accuracy of bioinformatics outputs, and users should follow standard practices for validating computational analyses. This integration is not officially endorsed by or affiliated with the nf-core community.

# Instrument Data to Allotrope Converter

Convert instrument files into standardized Allotrope Simple Model (ASM) format for LIMS upload, data lakes, or handoff to data engineering teams.

> **Note: This is an Example Skill**
>
> This skill demonstrates how skills can support your data engineering tasks—automating schema transformations, parsing instrument outputs, and generating production-ready code.
>
> **To customize for your organization:**
> - Modify the `references/` files to include your company's specific schemas or ontology mappings
> - Use an MCP server to connect to systems that define your schemas (e.g., your LIMS, data catalog, or schema registry)
> - Extend the `scripts/` to handle proprietary instrument formats or internal data standards
>
> This pattern can be adapted for any data transformation workflow where you need to convert between formats or validate against organizational standards.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Detect instrument type** from file contents (auto-detect or user-specified)
2. **Parse file** using allotropy library (native) or flexible fallback parser
3. **Generate outputs**:
   - ASM JSON (full semantic structure)
   - Flattened CSV (2D tabular format)
   - Python parser code (for data engineer handoff)
4. **Deliver** files with summary and usage instructions

> **When Uncertain:** If you're unsure how to map a field to ASM (e.g., is this raw data or calculated? device setting or environmental condition?), ask the user for clarification. Refer to `references/field_classification_guide.md` for guidance, but when ambiguity remains, confirm with the user rather than guessing.

## Quick Start

```python
# Install requirements first
pip install allotropy pandas openpyxl pdfplumber --break-system-packages

# Core conversion
from allotropy.parser_factory import Vendor
from allotropy.to_allotrope import allotrope_from_file

# Convert with allotropy
asm = allotrope_from_file("instrument_data.csv", Vendor.BECKMAN_VI_CELL_BLU)
```

## Output Format Selection

**ASM JSON (default)** - Full semantic structure with ontology URIs
- Best for: LIMS systems expecting ASM, data lakes, long-term archival
- Validates against Allotrope schemas

**Flattened CSV** - 2D tabular representation
- Best for: Quick analysis, Excel users, systems without JSON support
- Each measurement becomes one row with metadata repeated

**Both** - Generate both formats for maximum flexibility

## Calculated Data Handling

**IMPORTANT:** Separate raw measurements from calculated/derived values.

- **Raw data** → `measurement-document` (direct instrument readings)
- **Calculated data** → `calculated-data-aggregate-document` (derived values)

Calculated values MUST include traceability via `data-source-aggregate-document`:

```json
"calculated-data-aggregate-document": {
  "calculated-data-document": [{
    "calculated-data-identifier": "SAMPLE_B1_DIN_001",
    "calculated-data-name": "DNA integrity number",
    "calculated-result": {"value": 9.5, "unit": "(unitless)"},
    "data-source-aggregate-document": {
      "data-source-document": [{
        "data-source-identifier": "SAMPLE_B1_MEASUREMENT",
        "data-source-feature": "electrophoresis trace"
      }]
    }
  }]
}
```

**Common calculated fields by instrument type:**
| Instrument | Calculated Fields |
|------------|-------------------|
| Cell counter | Viability %, cell density dilution-adjusted values |
| Spectrophotometer | Concentration (from absorbance), 260/280 ratio |
| Plate reader | Concentrations from standard curve, %CV |
| Electrophoresis | DIN/RIN, region concentrations, average sizes |
| qPCR | Relative quantities, fold change |

See `references/field_classification_guide.md` for detailed guidance on raw vs. calculated classification.

## Validation

Always validate ASM output before delivering to the user:

```bash
python scripts/validate_asm.py output.json
python scripts/validate_asm.py output.json --reference known_good.json  # Compare to reference
python scripts/validate_asm.py output.json --strict  # Treat warnings as errors
```

**Validation Rules:**
- Based on Allotrope ASM specification (December 2024)
- Last updated: 2026-01-07
- Source: https://gitlab.com/allotrope-public/asm

**Soft Validation Approach:**
Unknown techniques, units, or sample roles generate **warnings** (not errors) to allow for forward compatibility. If Allotrope adds new values after December 2024, the validator won't block them—it will flag them for manual verification. Use `--strict` mode to treat warnings as errors if you need stricter validation.

**What it checks:**
- Correct technique selection (e.g., multi-analyte profiling vs plate reader)
- Field naming conventions (space-separated, not hyphenated)
- Calculated data has traceability (`data-source-aggregate-document`)
- Unique identifiers exist for measurements and calculated values
- Required metadata present
- Valid units and sample roles (with soft validation for unknown values)

## Supported Instruments

See `references/supported_instruments.md` for complete list. Key instruments:

| Category | Instruments |
|----------|-------------|
| Cell Counting | Vi-CELL BLU, Vi-CELL XR, NucleoCounter |
| Spectrophotometry | NanoDrop One/Eight/8000, Lunatic |
| Plate Readers | SoftMax Pro, EnVision, Gen5, CLARIOstar |
| ELISA | SoftMax Pro, BMG MARS, MSD Workbench |
| qPCR | QuantStudio, Bio-Rad CFX |
| Chromatography | Empower, Chromeleon |

## Detection & Parsing Strategy

### Tier 1: Native allotropy parsing (PREFERRED)
**Always try allotropy first.** Check available vendors directly:

```python
from allotropy.parser_factory import Vendor

# List all supported vendors
for v in Vendor:
    print(f"{v.name}")

# Common vendors:
# AGILENT_TAPESTATION_ANALYSIS  (for TapeStation XML)
# BECKMAN_VI_CELL_BLU
# THERMO_FISHER_NANODROP_EIGHT
# MOLDEV_SOFTMAX_PRO
# APPBIO_QUANTSTUDIO
# ... many more
```

**When the user provides a file, check if allotropy supports it before falling back to manual parsing.** The `scripts/convert_to_asm.py` auto-detection only covers a subset of allotropy vendors.

### Tier 2: Flexible fallback parsing
**Only use if allotropy doesn't support the instrument.** This fallback:
- Does NOT generate `calculated-data-aggregate-document`
- Does NOT include full traceability
- Produces simplified ASM structure

Use flexible parser with:
- Column name fuzzy matching
- Unit extraction from headers
- Metadata extraction from file structure

### Tier 3: PDF extraction
For PDF-only files, extract tables using pdfplumber, then apply Tier 2 parsing.

## Pre-Parsing Checklist

Before writing a custom parser, ALWAYS:

1. **Check if allotropy supports it** - Use native parser if available
2. **Find a reference ASM file** - Check `references/examples/` or ask user
3. **Review instrument-specific guide** - Check `references/instrument_guides/`
4. **Validate against reference** - Run `validate_asm.py --reference <file>`

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| Manifest as object | Use URL string |
| Lowercase detection types | Use "Absorbance" not "absorbance" |
| "emission wavelength setting" | Use "detector wavelength setting" for emission |
| All measurements in one document | Group by well/sample location |
| Missing procedure metadata | Extract ALL device settings per measurement |

## Code Export for Data Engineers

Generate standalone Python scripts that scientists can hand off:

```python
# Export parser code
python scripts/export_parser.py --input "data.csv" --vendor "VI_CELL_BLU" --output "parser_script.py"
```

The exported script:
- Has no external dependencies beyond pandas/allotropy
- Includes inline documentation
- Can run in Jupyter notebooks
- Is production-ready for data pipelines

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Vi-CELL BLU file
```
User: "Convert this cell counting data to Allotrope format"
[uploads viCell_Results.xlsx]

Claude:
1. Detects Vi-CELL BLU (95% confidence)
2. Converts using allotropy native parser
3. Outputs:
   - viCell_Results_asm.json (full ASM)
   - viCell_Results_flat.csv (2D format)
   - viCell_parser.py (exportable code)
```

### Example 2: Request for code handoff
```
User: "I need to give our data engineer code to parse NanoDrop files"

Claude:
1. Generates self-contained Python script
2. Includes sample input/output
3. Documents all assumptions
4. Provides Jupyter notebook version
```

### Example 3: LIMS-ready flattened output
```
User: "Convert this ELISA data to a CSV I can upload to our LIMS"

Claude:
1. Parses plate reader data
2. Generates flattened CSV with columns:
   - sample_identifier, well_position, measurement_value, measurement_unit
   - instrument_serial_number, analysis_datetime, assay_type
3. Validates against common LIMS import requirements
```

## Implementation Notes

### Installing allotropy
```bash
pip install allotropy --break-system-packages
```

### Handling parse failures
If allotropy native parsing fails:
1. Log the error for debugging
2. Fall back to flexible parser
3. Report reduced metadata completeness to user
4. Suggest exporting different format from instrument

### ASM Schema Validation
Validate output against Allotrope schemas when available:
```python
import jsonschema
# Schema URLs in references/asm_schema_overview.md
```
