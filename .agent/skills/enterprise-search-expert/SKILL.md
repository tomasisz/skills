# Search Strategy

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md).

The core intelligence behind enterprise search. Transforms a single natural language question into parallel, source-specific searches and produces ranked, deduplicated results.

## The Goal

Turn this:
```
"What did we decide about the API migration timeline?"
```

Into targeted searches across every connected source:
```
~~chat:  "API migration timeline decision" (semantic) + "API migration" in:#engineering after:2025-01-01
~~knowledge base: semantic search "API migration timeline decision"
~~project tracker:  text search "API migration" in relevant workspace
```

Then synthesize the results into a single coherent answer.

## Query Decomposition

### Step 1: Identify Query Type

Classify the user's question to determine search strategy:

| Query Type | Example | Strategy |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Decision** | "What did we decide about X?" | Prioritize conversations (~~chat, email), look for conclusion signals |
| **Status** | "What's the status of Project Y?" | Prioritize recent activity, task trackers, status updates |
| **Document** | "Where's the spec for Z?" | Prioritize Drive, wiki, shared docs |
| **Person** | "Who's working on X?" | Search task assignments, message authors, doc collaborators |
| **Factual** | "What's our policy on X?" | Prioritize wiki, official docs, then confirmatory conversations |
| **Temporal** | "When did X happen?" | Search with broad date range, look for timestamps |
| **Exploratory** | "What do we know about X?" | Broad search across all sources, synthesize |

### Step 2: Extract Search Components

From the query, extract:

- **Keywords**: Core terms that must appear in results
- **Entities**: People, projects, teams, tools (use memory system if available)
- **Intent signals**: Decision words, status words, temporal markers
- **Constraints**: Time ranges, source hints, author filters
- **Negations**: Things to exclude

### Step 3: Generate Sub-Queries Per Source

For each available source, create one or more targeted queries:

**Prefer semantic search** for:
- Conceptual questions ("What do we think about...")
- Questions where exact keywords are unknown
- Exploratory queries

**Prefer keyword search** for:
- Known terms, project names, acronyms
- Exact phrases the user quoted
- Filter-heavy queries (from:, in:, after:)

**Generate multiple query variants** when the topic might be referred to differently:
```
User: "Kubernetes setup"
Queries: "Kubernetes", "k8s", "cluster", "container orchestration"
```

## Source-Specific Query Translation

### ~~chat

**Semantic search** (natural language questions):
```
query: "What is the status of project aurora?"
```

**Keyword search:**
```
query: "project aurora status update"
query: "aurora in:#engineering after:2025-01-15"
query: "from:<@UserID> aurora"
```

**Filter mapping:**
| Enterprise filter | ~~chat syntax |
|------------------|--------------|
| `from:sarah` | `from:sarah` or `from:<@USERID>` |
| `in:engineering` | `in:engineering` |
| `after:2025-01-01` | `after:2025-01-01` |
| `before:2025-02-01` | `before:2025-02-01` |
| `type:thread` | `is:thread` |
| `type:file` | `has:file` |

### ~~knowledge base (Wiki)

**Semantic search** — Use for conceptual queries:
```
descriptive_query: "API migration timeline and decision rationale"
```

**Keyword search** — Use for exact terms:
```
query: "API migration"
query: "\"API migration timeline\""  (exact phrase)
```

### ~~project tracker

**Task search:**
```
text: "API migration"
workspace: [workspace_id]
completed: false  (for status queries)
assignee_any: "me"  (for "my tasks" queries)
```

**Filter mapping:**
| Enterprise filter | ~~project tracker parameter |
|------------------|----------------|
| `from:sarah` | `assignee_any` or `created_by_any` |
| `after:2025-01-01` | `modified_on_after: "2025-01-01"` |
| `type:milestone` | `resource_subtype: "milestone"` |

## Result Ranking

### Relevance Scoring

Score each result on these factors (weighted by query type):

| Factor | Weight (Decision) | Weight (Status) | Weight (Document) | Weight (Factual) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Keyword match | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.3 |
| Freshness | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.1 |
| Authority | 0.2 | 0.1 | 0.3 | 0.4 |
| Completeness | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.1 | 0.2 |

### Authority Hierarchy

Depends on query type:

**For factual/policy questions:**
```
Wiki/Official docs > Shared documents > Email announcements > Chat messages
```

**For "what happened" / decision questions:**
```
Meeting notes > Thread conclusions > Email confirmations > Chat messages
```

**For status questions:**
```
Task tracker > Recent chat > Status docs > Email updates
```

## Handling Ambiguity

When a query is ambiguous, prefer asking one focused clarifying question over guessing:

```
Ambiguous: "search for the migration"
→ "I found references to a few migrations. Are you looking for:
   1. The database migration (Project Phoenix)
   2. The cloud migration (AWS → GCP)
   3. The email migration (Exchange → O365)"
```

Only ask for clarification when:
- There are genuinely distinct interpretations that would produce very different results
- The ambiguity would significantly affect which sources to search

Do NOT ask for clarification when:
- The query is clear enough to produce useful results
- Minor ambiguity can be resolved by returning results from multiple interpretations

## Fallback Strategies

When a source is unavailable or returns no results:

1. **Source unavailable**: Skip it, search remaining sources, note the gap
2. **No results from a source**: Try broader query terms, remove date filters, try alternate keywords
3. **All sources return nothing**: Suggest query modifications to the user
4. **Rate limited**: Note the limitation, return results from other sources, suggest retrying later

### Query Broadening

If initial queries return too few results:
```
Original: "PostgreSQL migration Q2 timeline decision"
Broader:  "PostgreSQL migration"
Broader:  "database migration"
Broadest: "migration"
```

Remove constraints in this order:
1. Date filters (search all time)
2. Source/location filters
3. Less important keywords
4. Keep only core entity/topic terms

## Parallel Execution

Always execute searches across sources in parallel, never sequentially. The total search time should be roughly equal to the slowest single source, not the sum of all sources.

```
[User query]
     ↓ decompose
[~~chat query] [~~email query] [~~cloud storage query] [Wiki query] [~~project tracker query]
     ↓            ↓            ↓              ↓            ↓
  (parallel execution)
     ↓
[Merge + Rank + Deduplicate]
     ↓
[Synthesized answer]

# Knowledge Synthesis

The last mile of enterprise search. Takes raw results from multiple sources and produces a coherent, trustworthy answer.

## The Goal

Transform this:
```
~~chat result: "Sarah said in #eng: 'let's go with REST, GraphQL is overkill for our use case'"
~~email result: "Subject: API Decision — Sarah's email confirming REST approach with rationale"
~~cloud storage result: "API Design Doc v3 — updated section 2 to reflect REST decision"
~~project tracker result: "Task: Finalize API approach — marked complete by Sarah"
```

Into this:
```
The team decided to go with REST over GraphQL for the API redesign. Sarah made the
call, noting that GraphQL was overkill for the current use case. This was discussed
in #engineering on Tuesday, confirmed via email Wednesday, and the design doc has
been updated to reflect the decision. The related ~~project tracker task is marked complete.

Sources:
- ~~chat: #engineering thread (Jan 14)
- ~~email: "API Decision" from Sarah (Jan 15)
- ~~cloud storage: "API Design Doc v3" (updated Jan 15)
- ~~project tracker: "Finalize API approach" (completed Jan 15)
```

## Deduplication

### Cross-Source Deduplication

The same information often appears in multiple places. Identify and merge duplicates:

**Signals that results are about the same thing:**
- Same or very similar text content
- Same author/sender
- Timestamps within a short window (same day or adjacent days)
- References to the same entity (project name, document, decision)
- One source references another ("as discussed in ~~chat", "per the email", "see the doc")

**How to merge:**
- Combine into a single narrative item
- Cite all sources where it appeared
- Use the most complete version as the primary text
- Add unique details from each source

### Deduplication Priority

When the same information exists in multiple sources, prefer:
```
1. The most complete version (fullest context)
2. The most authoritative source (official doc > chat)
3. The most recent version (latest update wins for evolving info)
```

### What NOT to Deduplicate

Keep as separate items when:
- The same topic is discussed but with different conclusions
- Different people express different viewpoints
- The information evolved meaningfully between sources (v1 vs v2 of a decision)
- Different time periods are represented

## Citation and Source Attribution

Every claim in the synthesized answer must be attributable to a source.

### Attribution Format

Inline for direct references:
```
Sarah confirmed the REST approach in her email on Wednesday.
The design doc was updated to reflect this (~~cloud storage: "API Design Doc v3").
```

Source list at the end for completeness:
```
Sources:
- ~~chat: #engineering discussion (Jan 14) — initial decision thread
- ~~email: "API Decision" from Sarah Chen (Jan 15) — formal confirmation
- ~~cloud storage: "API Design Doc v3" last modified Jan 15 — updated specification
```

### Attribution Rules

- Always name the source type (~~chat, ~~email, ~~cloud storage, etc.)
- Include the specific location (channel, folder, thread)
- Include the date or relative time
- Include the author when relevant
- Include document/thread titles when available
- For ~~chat, note the channel name
- For ~~email, note the subject line and sender
- For ~~cloud storage, note the document title

## Confidence Levels

Not all results are equally trustworthy. Assess confidence based on:

### Freshness

| Recency | Confidence impact |
|---------|------------------|
| Today / yesterday | High confidence for current state |
| This week | Good confidence |
| This month | Moderate — things may have changed |
| Older than a month | Lower confidence — flag as potentially outdated |

For status queries, heavily weight freshness. For policy/factual queries, freshness matters less.

### Authority

| Source type | Authority level |
|-------------|----------------|
| Official wiki / knowledge base | Highest — curated, maintained |
| Shared documents (final versions) | High — intentionally published |
| Email announcements | High — formal communication |
| Meeting notes | Moderate-high — may be incomplete |
| Chat messages (thread conclusions) | Moderate — informal but real-time |
| Chat messages (mid-thread) | Lower — may not reflect final position |
| Draft documents | Low — not finalized |
| Task comments | Contextual — depends on commenter |

### Expressing Confidence

When confidence is high (multiple fresh, authoritative sources agree):
```
The team decided to use REST for the API redesign. [direct statement]
```

When confidence is moderate (single source or somewhat dated):
```
Based on the discussion in #engineering last month, the team was leaning
toward REST for the API redesign. This may have evolved since then.
```

When confidence is low (old data, informal source, or conflicting signals):
```
I found a reference to an API migration discussion from three months ago
in ~~chat, but I couldn't find a formal decision document. The information
may be outdated. You might want to check with the team for current status.
```

### Conflicting Information

When sources disagree:
```
I found conflicting information about the API approach:
- The ~~chat discussion on Jan 10 suggested GraphQL
- But Sarah's email on Jan 15 confirmed REST
- The design doc (updated Jan 15) reflects REST

The most recent sources indicate REST was the final decision,
but the earlier ~~chat discussion explored GraphQL first.
```

Always surface conflicts rather than silently picking one version.

## Summarization Strategies

### For Small Result Sets (1-5 results)

Present each result with context. No summarization needed — give the user everything:
```
[Direct answer synthesized from results]

[Detail from source 1]
[Detail from source 2]

Sources: [full attribution]
```

### For Medium Result Sets (5-15 results)

Group by theme and summarize each group:
```
[Overall answer]

Theme 1: [summary of related results]
Theme 2: [summary of related results]

Key sources: [top 3-5 most relevant sources]
Full results: [count] items found across [sources]
```

### For Large Result Sets (15+ results)

Provide a high-level synthesis with the option to drill down:
```
[Overall answer based on most relevant results]

Summary:
- [Key finding 1] (supported by N sources)
- [Key finding 2] (supported by N sources)
- [Key finding 3] (supported by N sources)

Top sources:
- [Most authoritative/relevant source]
- [Second most relevant]
- [Third most relevant]

Found [total count] results across [source list].
Want me to dig deeper into any specific aspect?
```

### Summarization Rules

- Lead with the answer, not the search process
- Do not list raw results — synthesize them into narrative
- Group related items from different sources together
- Preserve important nuance and caveats
- Include enough detail that the user can decide whether to dig deeper
- Always offer to provide more detail if the result set was large

## Synthesis Workflow

```
[Raw results from all sources]
          ↓
[1. Deduplicate — merge same info from different sources]
          ↓
[2. Cluster — group related results by theme/topic]
          ↓
[3. Rank — order clusters and items by relevance to query]
          ↓
[4. Assess confidence — freshness × authority × agreement]
          ↓
[5. Synthesize — produce narrative answer with attribution]
          ↓
[6. Format — choose appropriate detail level for result count]
          ↓
[Coherent answer with sources]
```

## Anti-Patterns

**Do not:**
- List results source by source ("From ~~chat: ... From ~~email: ... From ~~cloud storage: ...")
- Include irrelevant results just because they matched a keyword
- Bury the answer under methodology explanation
- Present conflicting info without flagging the conflict
- Omit source attribution
- Present uncertain information with the same confidence as well-supported facts
- Summarize so aggressively that useful detail is lost

**Do:**
- Lead with the answer
- Group by topic, not by source
- Flag confidence levels when appropriate
- Surface conflicts explicitly
- Attribute all claims to sources
- Offer to go deeper when result sets are large

# Source Management

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md).

Knows what sources are available, helps connect new ones, and manages how sources are queried.

## Checking Available Sources

Determine which MCP sources are connected by checking available tools. Each source corresponds to a set of MCP tools:

| Source | Key capabilities |
|--------|-----------------|
| **~~chat** | Search messages, read channels and threads |
| **~~email** | Search messages, read individual emails |
| **~~cloud storage** | Search files, fetch document contents |
| **~~project tracker** | Search tasks, typeahead search |
| **~~CRM** | Query records (accounts, contacts, opportunities) |
| **~~knowledge base** | Semantic search, keyword search |

If a tool prefix is available, the source is connected and searchable.

## Guiding Users to Connect Sources

When a user searches but has few or no sources connected:

```
You currently have [N] source(s) connected: [list].

To expand your search, you can connect additional sources in your MCP settings:
- ~~chat — messages, threads, channels
- ~~email — emails, conversations, attachments
- ~~cloud storage — docs, sheets, slides
- ~~project tracker — tasks, projects, milestones
- ~~CRM — accounts, contacts, opportunities
- ~~knowledge base — wiki pages, knowledge base articles

The more sources you connect, the more complete your search results.
```

When a user asks about a specific tool that is not connected:

```
[Tool name] isn't currently connected. To add it:
1. Open your MCP settings
2. Add the [tool] MCP server configuration
3. Authenticate when prompted

Once connected, it will be automatically included in future searches.
```

## Source Priority Ordering

Different query types benefit from searching certain sources first. Use these priorities to weight results, not to skip sources:

### By Query Type

**Decision queries** ("What did we decide..."):
```
1. ~~chat (conversations where decisions happen)
2. ~~email (decision confirmations, announcements)
3. ~~cloud storage (meeting notes, decision logs)
4. Wiki (if decisions are documented)
5. Task tracker (if decisions are captured in tasks)
```

**Status queries** ("What's the status of..."):
```
1. Task tracker (~~project tracker — authoritative status)
2. ~~chat (real-time discussion)
3. ~~cloud storage (status docs, reports)
4. ~~email (status update emails)
5. Wiki (project pages)
```

**Document queries** ("Where's the doc for..."):
```
1. ~~cloud storage (primary doc storage)
2. Wiki / ~~knowledge base (knowledge base)
3. ~~email (docs shared via email)
4. ~~chat (docs shared in channels)
5. Task tracker (docs linked to tasks)
```

**People queries** ("Who works on..." / "Who knows about..."):
```
1. ~~chat (message authors, channel members)
2. Task tracker (task assignees)
3. ~~cloud storage (doc authors, collaborators)
4. ~~CRM (account owners, contacts)
5. ~~email (email participants)
```

**Factual/Policy queries** ("What's our policy on..."):
```
1. Wiki / ~~knowledge base (official documentation)
2. ~~cloud storage (policy docs, handbooks)
3. ~~email (policy announcements)
4. ~~chat (policy discussions)
```

### Default Priority (General Queries)

When query type is unclear:
```
1. ~~chat (highest volume, most real-time)
2. ~~email (formal communications)
3. ~~cloud storage (documents and files)
4. Wiki / ~~knowledge base (structured knowledge)
5. Task tracker (work items)
6. CRM (customer data)
```

## Rate Limiting Awareness

MCP sources may have rate limits. Handle them gracefully:

### Detection

Rate limit responses typically appear as:
- HTTP 429 responses
- Error messages mentioning "rate limit", "too many requests", or "quota exceeded"
- Throttled or delayed responses

### Handling

When a source is rate limited:

1. **Do not retry immediately** — respect the limit
2. **Continue with other sources** — do not block the entire search
3. **Inform the user**:
```
Note: [Source] is temporarily rate limited. Results below are from
[other sources]. You can retry in a few minutes to include [source].
```
4. **For digests** — if rate limited mid-scan, note which time range was covered before the limit hit

### Prevention

- Avoid unnecessary API calls — check if the source is likely to have relevant results before querying
- Use targeted queries over broad scans when possible
- For digests, batch requests where the API supports it
- Cache awareness: if a search was just run, avoid re-running the same query immediately

## Source Health

Track source availability during a session:

```
Source Status:
  ~~chat:        ✓ Available
  ~~email:        ✓ Available
  ~~cloud storage:  ✓ Available
  ~~project tracker:        ✗ Not connected
  ~~CRM:   ✗ Not connected
  ~~knowledge base:      ⚠ Rate limited (retry in 2 min)
```

When reporting search results, include which sources were searched so the user knows the scope of the answer.

## Adding Custom Sources

The enterprise search plugin works with any MCP-connected source. As new MCP servers become available, they can be added to the `.mcp.json` configuration. The search and digest commands will automatically detect and include new sources based on available tools.

To add a new source:
1. Add the MCP server configuration to `.mcp.json`
2. Authenticate if required
3. The source will be included in subsequent searches automatically
