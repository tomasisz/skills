# Draft Outreach

Research first, then draft. This skill never sends generic outreach - it always researches the prospect first to personalize the message. Works standalone with web search, supercharged when you connect your tools.

## Connectors (Optional)

| Connector | What It Adds |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Enrichment** | Verified email, phone, background details |
| **CRM** | Prior relationship context, existing contacts |
| **Email** | Create draft directly in your inbox |

> **No connectors?** Web research works great. I'll output the email text for you to copy.

## How It Works

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                      DRAFT OUTREACH                               |
|                                                                   |
|  Step 1: RESEARCH (always happens first)                         |
|  - Web search (default)                                           |
|  - + Enrichment (if enrichment tools connected)                  |
|  - + CRM (if CRM connected)                                      |
|                                                                   |
|  Step 2: DRAFT (based on research)                               |
|  - Personalized opening (from research)                          |
|  - Relevant hook (their priorities)                              |
|  - Clear CTA                                                      |
|                                                                   |
|  Step 3: DELIVER (based on connectors)                           |
|  - Email draft (if email connected)                              |
|  - Copy for LinkedIn (always)                                    |
|  - Output to user (always)                                        |

```

---

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Parse Request

```
Input patterns:
- "draft outreach to John Smith at Acme" → Person + company
- "write cold email to Acme's CTO" → Role + company
- "reach out to sarah@acme.com" → Email provided
- "LinkedIn message to [LinkedIn URL]" → Profile provided
```

### Step 2: Research First (Always)

**Use research-prospect skill internally:**
```
1. Web search for company + person
2. If Enrichment connected: Get verified contact info, background
3. If CRM connected: Check for prior relationship
```

**Must find before drafting:**
- Who they are (title, background)
- What the company does
- Recent news or trigger
- Personalization hook

### Step 3: Identify Hook

```
Priority order for hooks:
1. Trigger event (funding, hiring, news) → Most timely
2. Mutual connection → Social proof
3. Their content (post, article, talk) → Shows you did research
4. Company initiative → Relevant to their priorities
5. Role-based pain point → Least personal but still relevant
```

### Step 4: Draft Message

**Email Structure (AIDA):**
```
SUBJECT: [Personalized, <50 chars, no spam words]

[Opening: Personal hook - shows you researched them]

[Interest: Their problem/opportunity in 1-2 sentences]

[Desire: Brief proof point - similar company result]

[Action: Clear, low-friction CTA]

[Signature]
```

**LinkedIn Connection Request (<300 chars):**
```
Hi [Name], [Mutual connection/shared interest/genuine compliment].
Would love to connect. [No pitch]
```

**LinkedIn Follow-up Message:**
```
Thanks for connecting! [Value-first: insight, article, observation]

[Soft transition to why you reached out]

[Question, not pitch]
```

### Step 5: Create Email Draft

```
If email connector available:
1. Create draft with to, subject, body
2. Return draft link
3. Note: "Draft created - review and send"

If not available:
1. Output email text
2. Note: "Copy to your email client"
```

---

## Capability by Connector

| Capability | Web Only | + Enrichment | + CRM | + Email |
|------------|----------|--------------|-------|---------|
| Personalized opening | Basic | Deep | With history | Same |
| Verified email | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Background details | Public only | Full | Full | Full |
| Prior relationship | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Auto-create draft | No | No | No | Yes |

---

## Message Templates by Scenario

### Cold Outreach (No Prior Relationship)

```
Subject: [Their initiative] + [your angle]

Hi [Name],

[Personal hook based on research - news, content, mutual connection].

[1 sentence on their likely challenge based on role/company].

[Brief proof: "We helped [Similar Company] achieve [Result]".]

Worth a 15-min call to see if relevant?

[Signature]
```

### Warm Outreach (Have Met / Mutual Connection)

```
Subject: Following up from [context]

Hi [Name],

[Reference to how you know them / who connected you].

[Why reaching out now - their trigger].

[Specific value you can offer].

[CTA]
```

### Re-Engagement (Went Dark)

```
Subject: [Short, curiosity-driven]

Hi [Name],

[Acknowledge time passed without being guilt-trippy].

[New reason to reconnect - their news or your news].

[Simple question to re-open dialogue].

[Signature]
```

### Post-Event Follow-up

```
Subject: Great meeting you at [Event]

Hi [Name],

[Specific memory from conversation].

[Value-add: article, intro, resource related to what you discussed].

[Soft CTA for next conversation].
```

## Email Style Guidelines

1. **Be concise but informative** — Get to the point quickly. Busy people skim.
2. **No markdown formatting** — Never use asterisks, bold (**text**), or other markdown. Write plain text that looks natural in any email client.
3. **Short paragraphs** — 2-3 sentences max per paragraph. White space is your friend.
4. **Simple lists** — If listing items, use plain dashes. No fancy formatting.

**Good:**
```
Here's what I can share:
- Case study from a similar company
- 15-min intro call this week
- Quick demo if helpful
```

**Bad:**
```
**What I Can Offer:**
- **Case study** from a similar company
- **Intro call** this week
```

---

## What NOT to Do

**Generic openers:**
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "I'm reaching out because..."
- "I wanted to introduce myself"

**Feature dumps:**
- Long paragraphs about your product
- Multiple value props at once
- No clear CTA

**Fake personalization:**
- "I noticed you work at [Company]" (obviously)
- "Congrats on your role" (without context)

**Markdown in emails:**
- Using **bold** or *italic* asterisks
- Headers or formatted lists that won't render

**Instead:**
- Lead with something specific you learned
- One clear value prop
- One clear ask
- Plain text formatting only

---

## Channel Selection

```
IF verified email available:
  → Email preferred (higher response rate)
  → Also provide LinkedIn backup

IF no email:
  → LinkedIn connection request
  → Follow-up message template for after connection

IF warm intro possible:
  → Suggest mutual connection outreach first
```

---

## Company Configuration [CUSTOMIZE]

```markdown
## Outreach Settings

- My name: [Your Name]
- My title: [Your Title]
- My company: [Company Name]
- Value prop: [One sentence - what you help with]

## Signature
[Your preferred email signature]

## Proof Points
- [Customer 1]: [Result]
- [Customer 2]: [Result]
- [Customer 3]: [Result]

## CTA Options
- Default: "Worth a 15-min call?"
- Softer: "Open to learning more?"
- Specific: "Can I send over a quick demo?"

## Tone
- [Professional / Casual / Direct]
- Industry-specific language: [Yes/No]
```

---

## Example

**Input:** "draft outreach to the Head of Engineering at Notion"

**Research finds:**
- Name: David Tibbitts
- Recent news: Notion launched AI features
- Hiring: 5 ML engineer roles open
- Background: Ex-Facebook, Stanford CS

**Output:**

```markdown
# Outreach Draft: David Tibbitts @ Notion

## Research Summary
**Target:** David Tibbitts, Head of Engineering at Notion
**Hook:** They're scaling AI features and hiring ML talent
**Goal:** Intro call about AI infrastructure

---

## Email Draft

**To:** david@notion.so
**Subject:** Notion's AI scaling + a thought

---

Hi David,

Saw Notion's AI rollout is gaining serious traction - congrats.
With 5 ML roles open, seems like you're scaling fast.

Curious how you're thinking about inference infrastructure
as usage grows. We helped [Similar Company] cut their AI
serving costs 40% while improving latency.

Worth a 15-min call to see if relevant to your roadmap?

Best,
[Name]

---

**Subject Alternatives:**
1. Notion AI + scaling question
2. Quick thought on Notion's ML hiring

# Create an Asset

Generate custom sales assets tailored to your prospect, audience, and goals. Supports interactive landing pages, presentation decks, executive one-pagers, and workflow/architecture demos.

---

## Triggers

Invoke this skill when:
- User says `/create-an-asset` or `/create-an-asset [CompanyName]`
- User asks to "create an asset", "build a demo", "make a landing page", "mock up a workflow"
- User needs a customer-facing deliverable for a sales conversation

---

## Overview

This skill creates professional sales assets by gathering context about:
- **(a) The Prospect** — company, contacts, conversations, pain points
- **(b) The Audience** — who's viewing, what they care about
- **(c) The Purpose** — goal of the asset, desired next action
- **(d) The Format** — landing page, deck, one-pager, or workflow demo

The skill then researches, structures, and builds a polished, branded asset ready to share with customers.

---

## Phase 0: Context Detection & Input Collection

### Step 0.1: Detect Seller Context

From the user's email domain, identify what company they work for.

**Actions:**
1. Extract domain from user's email
2. Search: `"[domain]" company products services site:linkedin.com OR site:crunchbase.com`
3. Determine seller context:

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Single-product company** | Auto-populate seller context |
| **Multi-product company** | Ask: "Which product or solution is this asset for?" |
| **Consultant/agency/generic domain** | Ask: "What company or product are you representing?" |
| **Unknown/startup** | Ask: "Briefly, what are you selling?" |

**Store seller context:**
```yaml
seller:
  company: "[Company Name]"
  product: "[Product/Service]"
  value_props:
    - "[Key value prop 1]"
    - "[Key value prop 2]"
    - "[Key value prop 3]"
  differentiators:
    - "[Differentiator 1]"
    - "[Differentiator 2]"
  pricing_model: "[If publicly known]"
```

**Persist to knowledge base** for future sessions. On subsequent invocations, confirm: "I have your seller context from last time — still selling [Product] at [Company]?"

---

### Step 0.2: Collect Prospect Context (a)

**Ask the user:**

| Field | Prompt | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Company** | "Which company is this asset for?" | ✓ Yes |
| **Key contacts** | "Who are the key contacts? (names, roles)" | No |
| **Deal stage** | "What stage is this deal?" | ✓ Yes |
| **Pain points** | "What pain points or priorities have they shared?" | No |
| **Past materials** | "Upload any conversation materials (transcripts, emails, notes, call recordings)" | No |

**Deal stage options:**
- Intro / First meeting
- Discovery
- Evaluation / Technical review
- POC / Pilot
- Negotiation
- Close

---

### Step 0.3: Collect Audience Context (b)

**Ask the user:**

| Field | Prompt | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Audience type** | "Who's viewing this?" | ✓ Yes |
| **Specific roles** | "Any specific titles to tailor for? (e.g., CTO, VP Engineering, CFO)" | No |
| **Primary concern** | "What do they care most about?" | ✓ Yes |
| **Objections** | "Any concerns or objections to address?" | No |

**Audience type options:**
- Executive (C-suite, VPs)
- Technical (Architects, Engineers, Developers)
- Operations (Ops, IT, Procurement)
- Mixed / Cross-functional

**Primary concern options:**
- ROI / Business impact
- Technical depth / Architecture
- Strategic alignment
- Risk mitigation / Security
- Implementation / Timeline

---

### Step 0.4: Collect Purpose Context (c)

**Ask the user:**

| Field | Prompt | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Goal** | "What's the goal of this asset?" | ✓ Yes |
| **Desired action** | "What should the viewer do after seeing this?" | ✓ Yes |

**Goal options:**
- Intro / First impression
- Discovery follow-up
- Technical deep-dive
- Executive alignment / Business case
- POC proposal
- Deal close

---

### Step 0.5: Select Format (d)

**Ask the user:** "What format works best for this?"

| Format | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Interactive landing page** | Multi-tab page with demos, metrics, calculators | Exec alignment, intros, value prop |
| **Deck-style** | Linear slides, presentation-ready | Formal meetings, large audiences |
| **One-pager** | Single-scroll executive summary | Leave-behinds, quick summaries |
| **Workflow / Architecture demo** | Interactive diagram with animated flow | Technical deep-dives, POC demos, integrations |

---

### Step 0.6: Format-Specific Inputs

#### If "Workflow / Architecture demo" selected:

**First, parse from user's description.** Look for:
- Systems and components mentioned
- Data flows described
- Human interaction points
- Example scenarios

**Then ask for any gaps:**

| If Missing... | Ask... |
|---------------|--------|
| Components unclear | "What systems or components are involved? (databases, APIs, AI, middleware, etc.)" |
| Flow unclear | "Walk me through the step-by-step flow" |
| Human touchpoints unclear | "Where does a human interact in this workflow?" |
| Scenario vague | "What's a concrete example scenario to demo?" |
| Integration specifics | "Any specific tools or platforms to highlight?" |

---

## Phase 1: Research (Adaptive)

### Assess Context Richness

| Level | Indicators | Research Depth |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Rich** | Transcripts uploaded, detailed pain points, clear requirements | Light — fill gaps only |
| **Moderate** | Some context, no transcripts | Medium — company + industry |
| **Sparse** | Just company name | Deep — full research pass |

### Always Research:

1. **Prospect basics**
   - Search: `"[Company]" annual report investor presentation 2025 2026`
   - Search: `"[Company]" CEO strategy priorities 2025 2026`
   - Extract: Revenue, employees, key metrics, strategic priorities

2. **Leadership**
   - Search: `"[Company]" CEO CTO CIO 2025`
   - Extract: Names, titles, recent quotes on strategy/technology

3. **Brand colors**
   - Search: `"[Company]" brand guidelines`
   - Or extract from company website
   - Store: Primary color, secondary color, accent

### If Moderate/Sparse Context, Also Research:

4. **Industry context**
   - Search: `"[Industry]" trends challenges 2025 2026`
   - Extract: Common pain points, market dynamics

5. **Technology landscape**
   - Search: `"[Company]" technology stack tools platforms`
   - Extract: Current solutions, potential integration points

6. **Competitive context**
   - Search: `"[Company]" vs [seller's competitors]`
   - Extract: Current solutions, switching signals

### If Transcripts/Materials Uploaded:

7. **Conversation analysis**
   - Extract: Stated pain points, decision criteria, objections, timeline
   - Identify: Key quotes to reference (use their exact language)
   - Note: Specific terminology, acronyms, internal project names

---

## Phase 2: Structure Decision

### Interactive Landing Page

| Purpose | Recommended Sections |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Intro** | Company Fit → Solution Overview → Key Use Cases → Why Us → Next Steps |
| **Discovery follow-up** | Their Priorities → How We Help → Relevant Examples → ROI Framework → Next Steps |
| **Technical deep-dive** | Architecture → Security & Compliance → Integration → Performance → Support |
| **Exec alignment** | Strategic Fit → Business Impact → ROI Calculator → Risk Mitigation → Partnership |
| **POC proposal** | Scope → Success Criteria → Timeline → Team → Investment → Next Steps |
| **Deal close** | Value Summary → Pricing → Implementation Plan → Terms → Sign-off |

**Audience adjustments:**
- **Executive**: Lead with business impact, ROI, strategic alignment
- **Technical**: Lead with architecture, security, integration depth
- **Operations**: Lead with workflow impact, change management, support
- **Mixed**: Balance strategic + tactical; use tabs to separate depth levels

---

### Deck-Style

Same sections as landing page, formatted as linear slides:

```
1. Title slide (Prospect + Seller logos, partnership framing)
2. Agenda
3-N. One section per slide (or 2-3 slides for dense sections)
N+1. Summary / Key takeaways
N+2. Next steps / CTA
N+3. Appendix (optional — detailed specs, pricing, etc.)
```

**Slide principles:**
- One key message per slide
- Visual > text-heavy
- Use prospect's metrics and language
- Include speaker notes

---

### One-Pager

Condense to single-scroll format:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ HERO: "[Prospect Goal] with [Product]" │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ KEY POINT 1     │ KEY POINT 2     │ KEY POINT 3     │
│ [Icon + 2-3     │ [Icon + 2-3     │ [Icon + 2-3     │
│  sentences]     │  sentences]     │  sentences]     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ PROOF POINT: [Metric, quote, or case study] │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ CTA: [Clear next action] │ [Contact info] │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### Workflow / Architecture Demo

**Structure based on complexity:**

| Complexity | Components | Structure |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| **Simple** | 3-5 | Single-view diagram with step annotations |
| **Medium** | 5-10 | Zoomable canvas with step-by-step walkthrough |
| **Complex** | 10+ | Multi-layer view (overview → detailed) with guided tour |

**Standard elements:**

1. **Title bar**: `[Scenario Name] — Powered by [Seller Product]`
2. **Component nodes**: Visual boxes/icons for each system
3. **Flow arrows**: Animated connections showing data movement
4. **Step panel**: Sidebar explaining current step in plain language
5. **Controls**: Play / Pause / Step Forward / Step Back / Reset
6. **Annotations**: Callouts for key decision points and value-adds
7. **Data preview**: Sample payloads or transformations at each step

---

## Phase 3: Content Generation

### General Principles

All content should:
- Reference **specific pain points** from user input or transcripts
- Use **prospect's language** — their terminology, their stated priorities
- Map **seller's product** → **prospect's needs** explicitly
- Include **proof points** where available (case studies, metrics, quotes)
- Feel **tailored, not templated**

---

### Section Templates

#### Hero / Intro
```
Headline: "[Prospect's Goal] with [Seller's Product]"
Subhead: Tie to their stated priority or top industry challenge
Metrics: 3-4 key facts about the prospect (shows we did homework)
```

#### Their Priorities (if discovery follow-up)
```
Reference specific pain points from conversation:
- Use their exact words where possible
- Show we listened and understood
- Connect each to how we help
```

#### Solution Mapping
```
For each pain point:
├── The challenge (in their words)
├── How [Product] addresses it
├── Proof point or example
└── Outcome / benefit
```

#### Use Cases / Demos
```
3-5 relevant use cases:
├── Visual mockup or interactive demo
├── Business impact (quantified if possible)
├── "How it works" — 3-4 step summary
└── Relevant to their industry/role
```

#### ROI / Business Case
```
Interactive calculator with:
├── Inputs relevant to their business (from research)
│   ├── Number of users/developers
│   ├── Current costs or time spent
│   └── Expected improvement %
├── Outputs:
│   ├── Annual value / savings
│   ├── Cost of solution
│   ├── Net ROI
│   └── Payback period
└── Assumptions clearly stated (editable)
```

#### Why Us / Differentiators
```
├── Differentiators vs. alternatives they might consider
├── Trust, security, compliance positioning
├── Support and partnership model
└── Customer proof points (logos, quotes, case studies)
```

#### Next Steps / CTA
```
├── Clear action aligned to Purpose (c)
├── Specific next step (not vague "let's chat")
├── Contact information
├── Suggested timeline
└── What happens after they take action
```

---

### Workflow Demo Content

#### Component Definitions

For each system, define:

```yaml
component:
  id: "snowflake"
  label: "Snowflake Data Warehouse"
  type: "database"  # database | api | ai | middleware | human | document | output
  icon: "database"
  description: "Financial performance data"
  brand_color: "#29B5E8"
```

**Component types:**
- `human` — Person initiating or receiving

- `ai` — AI/ML models, agents
- `database` — Data stores, warehouses
- `api` — APIs, services
- `middleware` — Integration platforms, MCP servers
- `output` — Dashboards, reports, notifications

#### Flow Steps

For each step, define:

```yaml
step:
  number: 1
  from: "human"
  to: "claude"
  action: "Initiates performance review"
  description: "Sarah, a Brand Analyst at [Prospect], kicks off the quarterly review..."
  data_example: "Review request: Nike brand, Q4 2025"
  duration: "~1 second"
  value_note: "No manual data gathering required"
```

#### Scenario Narrative

Write a clear, specific walkthrough:

```
Step 1: Human Trigger
"Sarah, a Brand Performance Analyst at Centric Brands, needs to review
Q4 performance for the Nike license agreement. She opens the review
dashboard and clicks 'Start Review'..."

Step 2: Contract Analysis
"Claude retrieves the Nike contract PDF and extracts the performance
obligations: minimum $50M revenue, 12% margin requirement, quarterly
reporting deadline..."

Step 3: Data Query
"Claude formulates a query and sends it to Workato DataGenie:
'Get Q4 2025 revenue and gross margin for Nike brand from Snowflake'..."

Step 4: Results & Synthesis
"Snowflake returns the data. Claude compares actuals vs. obligations:
Revenue $52.3M ✓ (exceeded by $2.3M)
Margin 11.2% ⚠️ (0.8% below threshold)..."

Step 5: Insight Delivery
"Claude synthesizes findings into an executive summary with
recommendations: 'Review promotional spend allocation to improve
margin performance...'"
```

    overflow: auto;
}
```

## Phase 5: Clarifying Questions (REQUIRED)

**Before building any asset, always ask clarifying questions.** This ensures alignment and prevents wasted effort.

### Step 5.1: Summarize Understanding

First, show the user what you understood:

```
"Here's what I'm planning to build:

**Asset**: [Format] for [Prospect Company]
**Audience**: [Audience type] — specifically [roles if known]
**Goal**: [Purpose] → driving toward [desired action]
**Key themes**: [2-3 main points to emphasize]

[For workflow demos, also show:]
**Components**: [List of systems]
**Flow**: [Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Step 3] → ...
```

### Step 5.2: Ask Standard Questions (ALL formats)

| Question | Why |
|----------|-----|
| "Does this match your vision?" | Confirm understanding |
| "What's the ONE thing this must nail to succeed?" | Focus on priority |
| "Tone preference? (Bold & confident / Consultative / Technical & precise)" | Style alignment |
| "Focused and concise, or comprehensive?" | Scope calibration |

### Step 5.3: Ask Format-Specific Questions

#### Interactive Landing Page:
- "Which sections matter most for this audience?"
- "Any specific demos or use cases to highlight?"
- "Should I include an ROI calculator?"
- "Any competitor positioning to address?"

#### Deck-Style:
- "How long is the presentation? (helps with slide count)"
- "Presenting live, or a leave-behind?"
- "Any specific flow or narrative arc in mind?"

#### One-Pager:
- "What's the single most important message?"
- "Any specific proof point or stat to feature?"
- "Will this be printed or digital?"

#### Workflow / Architecture Demo:
- "Let me confirm the components: [list]. Anything missing?"
- "Here's the flow I understood: [steps]. Correct?"
- "Should the demo show realistic sample data, or keep it abstract?"
- "Any integration details to highlight or downplay?"
- "Should viewers be able to click through steps, or auto-play?"

### Step 5.4: Confirm and Proceed

After user responds:

```
"Got it. I have what I need. Building your [format] now..."
```

Or, if still unclear:

```
"One more quick question: [specific follow-up]"
```

**Max 2 rounds of questions.** If still ambiguous, make a reasonable choice and note: "I went with X — easy to adjust if you prefer Y."

---

## Phase 6: Build & Deliver

### Build the Asset

Following all specifications above:
1. Generate structure based on Phase 2
2. Create content based on Phase 3
3. Apply visual design based on Phase 4
4. Ensure all interactive elements work
5. Test responsiveness (if applicable)

### Output Format

**All formats**: Self-contained HTML file
- All CSS inline or in `<style>` tags
- All JS inline or in `<script>` tags
- No external dependencies (except Google Fonts)
- Single file for easy sharing

**File naming**: `[ProspectName]-[format]-[date].html`
- Example: `CentricBrands-workflow-demo-2026-01-28.html`

### Delivery Message

```markdown
## ✓ Asset Created: [Prospect Name]

[View your asset](computer:///path/to/file.html)

---

**Summary**
- **Format**: [Interactive Page / Deck / One-Pager / Workflow Demo]
- **Audience**: [Type and roles]
- **Purpose**: [Goal] → [Desired action]
- **Sections/Steps**: [Count and list]

---

**Deployment Options**

To share this with your customer:
- **Static hosting**: Upload to Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS S3, or any static host
- **Password protection**: Most hosts offer this (e.g., Netlify site protection)
- **Direct share**: Send the HTML file directly — it's fully self-contained
- **Embed**: The file can be iframed into other pages if needed

---

**Customization**

Let me know if you'd like to:
- Adjust colors or styling
- Add, remove, or reorder sections
- Refine any messaging or copy
- Change the flow or architecture (for workflow demos)
- Add more interactive elements
- Export as PDF or static images
```

---

## Phase 7: Iteration Support

After delivery, be ready to iterate:

| User Request | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| "Change the colors" | Regenerate with new palette, keep content |
| "Add a section on X" | Insert new section, maintain flow |
| "Make it shorter" | Condense, prioritize key points |
| "The flow is wrong" | Rebuild architecture based on correction |
| "Use our brand instead" | Switch from prospect brand to seller brand |
| "Add more detail on step 3" | Expand that section specifically |
| "Can I get this as a PDF?" | Provide print-optimized version |

**Remember**: Default to prospect's brand colors, but seller can adjust to their own brand or a neutral palette after initial build.

## Getting Started

When you run this skill, I'll ask for what I need:

**If no calendar connected:**
> "What meetings do you have today? (Just paste your calendar or list them)"

**If no CRM connected:**
> "What deals are you focused on this week? Any that need attention?"

**If you have connectors:**
I'll pull everything automatically and just show you the briefing.

---

## Connectors (Optional)

Connect your tools to supercharge this skill:

| Connector | What It Adds |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Calendar** | Today's meetings with attendees, times, and context |
| **CRM** | Open pipeline, deals closing soon, overdue tasks, stale deals |
| **Email** | Unread from opportunity contacts, emails waiting on replies |
| **Enrichment** | Overnight signals: funding, hiring, news on your accounts |

> **No connectors?** No problem. Tell me your meetings and deals, and I'll create your briefing.

3. **[Action]** — [Why now]

---

*Run `call-prep [company]` before your meetings*
*Run `call-follow-up` after each call*
```

---

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Gather Context

**If connectors available:**
```
1. Calendar → Get today's events
   - Filter to external meetings (non-company attendees)
   - Pull: time, title, attendees, description

2. CRM → Query your pipeline
   - Open opportunities owned by you
   - Flag: closing this week, no activity 7+ days, slipped dates
   - Get: overdue tasks, upcoming tasks

3. Email → Check priority messages
   - Unread from opportunity contact domains
   - Sent messages with no reply (3+ days)

4. Enrichment → Check signals (if available)
   - Funding, hiring, news on open accounts
```

**If no connectors:**
```
Ask user:
1. "What meetings do you have today?"
2. "What deals are you focused on? Any closing soon or needing attention?"
3. "Anything urgent I should know about?"

Work with whatever they provide.
```

### Step 2: Prioritize

```
Priority ranking:
1. URGENT: Deal closing today/tomorrow not yet won
2. HIGH: Meeting today with high-value opportunity
3. HIGH: Unread email from decision-maker
4. MEDIUM: Deal closing this week
5. MEDIUM: Stale deal (7+ days no activity)
6. LOW: Tasks due this week

Select #1 Priority:
- If meeting with >$50K deal today → prep that
- If deal closing today → focus on close
- If urgent email from buyer → respond first
- Else → highest-value stale deal
```

### Step 3: Generate Briefing

```
Assemble sections based on available data:

1. #1 Priority — Always include (even if simple)
2. Today's Numbers — If CRM connected, otherwise skip
3. Today's Meetings — From calendar or user input
4. Pipeline Alerts — If CRM connected
5. Email Priorities — If email connected
6. Suggested Actions — Always include top 3 actions
```

---

## Quick Mode

Say "quick brief" or "tldr my day" for abbreviated version:

```markdown
# Quick Brief | [Date]

**#1:** [Priority action]

**Meetings:** [N] — [Company 1], [Company 2], [Company 3]

**Alerts:**
- [Alert 1]
- [Alert 2]

**Do Now:** [Single most important action]
```

---

## End of Day Mode

Say "wrap up my day" or "end of day summary" after your last meeting:

```markdown
# End of Day | [Date]

**Completed:**
- [Meeting 1] — [Outcome]
- [Meeting 2] — [Outcome]

**Pipeline Changes:**
- [Deal] moved to [Stage]

**Tomorrow's Focus:**
- [Priority 1]
- [Priority 2]

**Open Loops:**
- [ ] [Unfinished item needing follow-up]
```

---

## Tips

1. **Connect your calendar first** — Biggest time saver
2. **Add CRM second** — Unlocks pipeline alerts
3. **Even without connectors** — Just tell me your meetings and I'll help prioritize

- "Who is the CTO at Notion" → Role-based search
- "Intel on acme.com" → Domain-based lookup
```

### Step 2: Web Search (Always)

Run these searches:
1. "[Company name]" → Homepage, about page
2. "[Company name] news" → Recent announcements
3. "[Company name] funding" → Investment history
4. "[Company name] careers" → Hiring signals

- Open job postings
- Technology mentions
- Customer base

### Step 3: Enrichment (If Connected)

```
If enrichment tools available:
1. Enrich company → Firmographics, funding, tech stack

3. Enrich person → Email, phone, background
4. Get signals → Intent data, hiring velocity
```

**Enrichment adds:**
- Verified contact info

- Precise employee count
- Detailed tech stack
- Funding history with investors

### Step 4: CRM Check (If Connected)

```

**CRM adds:**
- Prior relationship context

- Who we've talked to
- Notes and history

### Step 5: Synthesize

```
1. Combine all sources
2. Prioritize enrichment data over web (more accurate)
3. Add CRM context if exists
4. Identify qualification signals
5. Generate talking points
6. Recommend approach
```

## Research Variations

### Company Research
Focus on: Business overview, news, hiring, leadership

### Person Research
Focus on: Background, role, LinkedIn activity, talking points

### Competitor Research
Focus on: Product comparison, positioning, win/loss patterns

### Pre-Meeting Research
Focus on: Attendee backgrounds, recent news, relationship history

---

## Tips for Better Research

1. **Include the domain** — "research acme.com" is more precise
2. **Specify the person** — "look up Jane Smith, VP Sales at Acme"
3. **State your goal** — "research Stripe before my demo call"
4. **Ask for specifics** — "what's their tech stack?" after initial research

## Getting Started

When you run this skill, I'll ask for context:

**Required:**
- What company do you work for? (or I'll detect from your email)
- Who are your main competitors? (1-5 names)

**Optional:**
- Which competitor do you want to focus on first?
- Any specific deals where you're competing against them?
- Pain points you've heard from customers about competitors?

If I already have your seller context from a previous session, I'll confirm and skip the questions.

---

## Connectors (Optional)

| Connector | What It Adds |
|-----------|--------------|
| **CRM** | Win/loss history against each competitor, deal-level competitor tracking |
| **Docs** | Existing battlecards, product comparison docs, competitive playbooks |
| **Chat** | Internal chat intel (e.g. Slack) — what your team is hearing from the field |
| **Transcripts** | Competitor mentions in customer calls, objections raised |

> **No connectors?** Web research works great. I'll pull everything from public sources — product pages, pricing, blogs, release notes, reviews, job postings.

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Gather Seller Context

```
If first time:
1. Ask: "What company do you work for?"
2. Ask: "What do you sell? (product/service in one line)"
3. Ask: "Who are your main competitors? (up to 5)"
4. Store context for future sessions

If returning user:
1. Confirm: "Still at [Company] selling [Product]?"
2. Ask: "Same competitors, or any new ones to add?"
```

### Phase 2: Research Your Company (Always)

```
Web searches:
1. "[Your company] product" — current offerings
2. "[Your company] pricing" — pricing model
3. "[Your company] news" — recent announcements (90 days)
4. "[Your company] product updates OR changelog OR releases" — what you've shipped
5. "[Your company] vs [competitor]" — existing comparisons
```

### Phase 3: Research Each Competitor (Always)

```
For each competitor, run:
1. "[Competitor] product features" — what they offer
2. "[Competitor] pricing" — how they charge
3. "[Competitor] news" — recent announcements
4. "[Competitor] product updates OR changelog OR releases" — what they've shipped
5. "[Competitor] reviews G2 OR Capterra OR TrustRadius" — customer sentiment
6. "[Competitor] vs [alternatives]" — how they position
7. "[Competitor] customers" — who uses them
8. "[Competitor] careers" — hiring signals (growth areas)
```

### Phase 4: Pull Connected Sources (If Available)

```
If CRM connected:
1. Query closed-won deals with competitor field = [Competitor]
2. Query closed-lost deals with competitor field = [Competitor]
3. Extract win/loss patterns

If docs connected:
1. Search for "battlecard [competitor]"
2. Search for "competitive [competitor]"
3. Pull existing positioning docs

If chat connected:
1. Search for "[Competitor]" mentions (last 90 days)
2. Extract field intel and colleague insights

If transcripts connected:
1. Search calls for "[Competitor]" mentions
2. Extract objections and customer quotes
```

### Phase 5: Build HTML Artifact

```
1. Structure data for each competitor
2. Build comparison matrix
3. Generate individual battlecards
4. Create talk tracks for each scenario
5. Compile landmine questions
6. Render as self-contained HTML
7. Save as [YourCompany]-battlecard-[date].html
```

## Delivery

## ✓ Battlecard Created

[View your battlecard](file:///path/to/[YourCompany]-battlecard-[date].html)

---

**Summary**
- **Your Company**: [Name]
- **Competitors Analyzed**: [List]
- **Data Sources**: Web research [+ CRM] [+ Docs] [+ Transcripts]

---

**How to Use**
- **Before a call**: Open the relevant competitor tab, review talk tracks
- **During a call**: Reference landmine questions
- **After win/loss**: Update with new intel

---

**Sharing Options**
- **Local file**: Open in any browser
- **Host it**: Upload to Netlify, Vercel, or internal wiki
- **Share directly**: Send the HTML file to teammates

---

**Keep it Fresh**
Run this skill again to refresh with latest intel. Recommended: monthly or before major deals.
```

---

## Refresh Cadence

Competitive intel gets stale. Recommended refresh:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Monthly** | Quick refresh — new releases, news, pricing changes |
| **Before major deal** | Deep refresh for specific competitor in that deal |
| **After win/loss** | Update patterns with new data |
| **Competitor announcement** | Immediate update on that competitor |

---

## Tips for Better Intel

1. **Be honest about weaknesses** — Credibility comes from acknowledging where competitors are strong
2. **Focus on outcomes, not features** — "They have X feature" matters less than "customers achieve Y result"
3. **Update from the field** — Best intel comes from actual customer conversations, not just websites
4. **Plant landmines, don't badmouth** — Ask questions that expose weaknesses; never trash-talk
5. **Track releases religiously** — What they ship tells you their strategy and your opportunity

## Getting Started

When you run this skill, I'll ask for what I need:

**Required:**
- Company or contact name
- Meeting type (discovery, demo, negotiation, check-in, etc.)

**Helpful if you have it:**
- Who's attending (names and titles)
- Any context you want me to know (paste prior notes, emails, etc.)

If you've connected your CRM, email, or other tools, I'll pull context automatically and skip the questions.

---

## Connectors (Optional)

Connect your tools to supercharge this skill:

| Connector | What It Adds |
|-----------|--------------|
| **CRM** | Account details, contact history, open deals, recent activities |
| **Email** | Recent threads with the company, open questions, attachments shared |
| **Chat** | Internal chat discussions (e.g. Slack) about the account, colleague insights |
| **Transcripts** | Prior call recordings, topics covered, competitor mentions |
| **Calendar** | Auto-find the meeting, pull attendees and description |

> **No connectors?** No problem. Just tell me about the meeting and paste any context you have. I'll research the rest.

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Gather Context

**If connectors available:**
```
1. Calendar → Find upcoming meeting matching company name
   - Pull: title, time, attendees, description, attachments

2. CRM → Query account
   - Pull: account details, all contacts, open opportunities
   - Pull: last 10 activities, any account notes

3. Email → Search recent threads
   - Query: emails with company domain (last 30 days)
   - Extract: key topics, open questions, commitments

4. Chat → Search internal discussions
   - Query: company name mentions (last 30 days)
   - Extract: colleague insights, competitive intel

5. Transcripts → Find prior calls
   - Pull: call recordings with this account
   - Extract: key moments, objections raised, topics covered
```

**If no connectors:**
```
1. Ask user:
   - "What company are you meeting with?"
   - "What type of meeting is this?"
   - "Who's attending? (names and titles if you know)"
   - "Any context you want me to know? (paste notes, emails, etc.)"

2. Accept whatever they provide and work with it
```

### Step 2: Research Supplement

**Always run (web search):**
```
1. "[Company] news" — last 30 days
2. "[Company] funding" — recent announcements
3. "[Company] leadership" — executive changes
4. "[Company] + [industry] trends" — relevant context
5. Attendee LinkedIn profiles — background research
```

### Step 3: Synthesize & Generate

```
1. Combine all sources into unified context
2. Identify gaps in understanding → generate discovery questions
3. Anticipate objections based on stage and history
4. Create suggested agenda tailored to meeting type
5. Output formatted prep brief
```

## Tips for Better Prep

1. **More context = better prep** — Paste emails, notes, anything you have
2. **Name the attendees** — Even just titles help me research
3. **State your goal** — "I want to get them to agree to a pilot"
4. **Flag concerns** — "They mentioned budget is tight"
